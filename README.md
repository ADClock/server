# ADClock server
This project is the master for a ClockWall. It allows you to play with the clock wall as you want.

## Features
TODO (nothing by now)

## Requirements
Currently this project is build for an raspberry pi. See [raspberry-runner](https://github.com/ADClock/raspberry-runner) for a full setup guide.

Our goal is it, to make this code runnable on every maschine - even without an connected ADClock. So you can configure animations and push them later to your clock.
